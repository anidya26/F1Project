# F1Project
This project analyzes Formula 1 data to extract insights into driver and circuit performance. It identifies the fastest circuits, most consistent drivers, and offers strategic racing recommendations. Built using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Loading and Merging:** Combines data from lap times, race results, and race details.
* **Lap Time Analysis:** Visualizes the distribution of lap times and identifies circuits with the fastest average lap times.
* **Driver Consistency:** Calculates and ranks drivers based on lap time consistency using standard deviation.
* **Circuit Performance:** Determines circuits with the fastest average lap times and visualizes their performance.
* **Strategic Recommendations:** Offers actionable insights for race strategy, driver selection, and performance optimization.

**Insights:**

* Identifies circuits with the fastest average lap times.
* Determines the most consistent drivers based on lap time variability.
* Provides recommendations for circuit-specific preparation, driver selection, and pit-stop strategies.

**Libraries Used:**

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Streamlit (optional for interactive visualization)

**Data Sources:**

* Formula 1 datasets (e.g., lap_times.csv, results.csv, races.csv)

**Disclaimer:** This project uses publicly available F1 data for educational and analytical purposes.
